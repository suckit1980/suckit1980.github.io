         <h1>Baby's New Gear</h1>

         <article>
            <h1>Strollers and Car seats</h1>
            <p>Buying your stroller and car seat together is generally a good idea
			so you can be sure that the car seat attaches to the stroller properly.
			We went with a jogging stroller so we can take baby on trail hikes. 
            </p>
			<h1>Cribs and Changing Station</h1>
            <p>This all important baby furniture will be apart of yours and baby's 
			daily lives pick something that is functional and esteticaly pleasing.
			We found great deals on craigslist.
            </p>

            <h1>Breast pumps and Nursing Pillows</h1>
			<p>Breast feeding is all important and keeping the milk flowing is
			important as well. We decided to go with a Medela breast pump. We read many 
			articles and all said Medela was the best.

            <h1>Places to buy baby gear.</h1>
            <p>After hours of watching my lovely lady shop I have deduced that these 
			   websites have the best gear at the most reasonable prices.
            </p>

               <dt>&#9758; <a href="http://www.babiesrus.com" 
			   target="new">Babies R Us</a></dt>
               <dd>Babies R us has agreat selection and they love to send you 
				   catalogs with useful coupons.

			   target="new">Target</a></dt>
               <dd>Targets website is suprisingly easy to set up a baby shower registry.  
                   They also have a great selection of strollers and car seats. If you 
				   want Eddie Bower this is the only store that carries that brand.

               <dd>Sears has a great selection of baby gear. Generally I think of Sears
